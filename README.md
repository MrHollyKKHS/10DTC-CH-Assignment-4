## Computer Buying Project
This project teaches students how to determine which computer is best for someone to buy. Students learn about computer components, what they do, computer types, and how they impact the decision to buy a computer. During this project the students will conduct an interview with a person interested in buying a computer for a particular purpose. The student will then use the information gathered through their research to determine which computer to recommend for purchase. There are a range of options for students to choose from for submitting evidence of learning for their final project. Students should work in groups of 1 or 2.
Learning Intention: To understand the different parts of a computer, how they work, and why some components are more important for some than others.
